# -Face-Recognition-using-OpenCV-and-CNN
 • Captured a dataset of 900 color face images from 9 students (100 images per student) using a webcam via the OpenCV (CV2) library.

• Integrated Haar Cascade Classifier (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml) for real-time face detection during data collection.

• Applied a series of image preprocessing techniques using OpenCV to enhance image quality and standardize input.

• Built a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture using ResNet50 (from scratch) to classify individuals based on facial features.

• Achieved 99.44% validation accuracy, demonstrating highly effective recognition performance.
