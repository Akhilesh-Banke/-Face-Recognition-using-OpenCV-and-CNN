# Face-Recognition-using-OpenCV-and-CNN


# Project Overview
This project demonstrates a robust face recognition pipeline built using OpenCV for image capture and preprocessing, and a custom Convolutional Neural Network based on ResNet50 for classification. The system was trained on a dataset of 900 color face images collected from 9 individuals (100 images per person), achieving a remarkable 99.44% validation accuracy.
